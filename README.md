# Design-and-verification-of-RISC-V-Single-Core-and-Pipeline-Architecture-

This repository contains Verilog HDL source code and verification infrastructure for a 32-bit RISC-V processor implemented in both single-cycle and five-stage pipeline architectures. It documents the design, simulation, synthesis, and validation of both architectures. Modules include program counter, register file, ALU, hazard detection units, and more. The verification suite features comprehensive testbenches, coverage analysis, and simulation logs.

## Features
- Single-cycle and pipelined RISC-V cores
- Hazard detection and forwarding for pipeline
- Automated verification testbenches
- Scripts for simulation and synthesis
- Waveform and report archives

## Getting Started
See `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/pipeline.md` for detailed documentation and setup instructions.
